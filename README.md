## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Dependency Updates

This repo-template includes preconfigured security files like dependabot.yml, codeql.yml, and SECURITY.md to help you build secure projects from the start.

- `.github/dependabot.yml` to keep dependencies up-to-date automatically (e.g., npm, GitHub Actions, pip).
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` to enable static code analysis for security vulnerabilities using GitHub CodeQL.
- `SECURITY.md` to help users report any discovered security vulnerability to the repo owner.

## To ensure full security coverage

### Repository Settings

    ‚úÖ Enable Dependabot alerts
    Settings > Code security and analysis > Dependabot alerts

    ‚úÖ Enable Secret scanning alerts
    Settings > Code security and analysis > Secret scanning

    ‚úÖ Enable private vulnerability reporting
    Settings > Code security and analysis > Private vulnerability reporting

### Review & Clean Up Configuration Files

    ‚úÖ Review .github/dependabot.yml
        Comment out or remove any unused ecosystems.
        Unused entries are ignored by GitHub, but trimming improves clarity.

    ‚úÖ Keep or remove .github/workflows/codeql.yml
        Leave it enabled for repos with source code (e.g., JS, Python, C#).
        Comment out or remove any unused ecosystems.
        Unused entries are ignored by GitHub, but email with errors will be sent to repo owner.
        CodeQL scanning is free for public repos and auto-runs on push/PR/weekly.

    ‚úÖ Add a suitable .gitignore based on your stack (e.g. Node.js, Vite, etc).
        Add a .env.example and ignore sensitive files like .env
        Consider documenting environment variables in README.md or .env.example

### Security Transparency

    ‚úÖ Let users report vulnerabilities via SECURITY.md
