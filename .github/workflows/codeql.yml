# CodeQL Security Analysis Workflow
# ---------------------------------------------
# ✅ This workflow runs GitHub's CodeQL security scanner on selected languages.
# It checks for vulnerabilities in source code on push, PR, and weekly.
#
# Tip: You can safely leave unused languages in the matrix.
# If the repository does not contain relevant files, CodeQL will skip that language silently.
#
# Adjust the `language` list below if you want to streamline the build or reduce scan time.
